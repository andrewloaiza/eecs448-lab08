      A little about me, I am one week old now.
      I like to sleep. I like to nap. I like to rest.
      I can't wait to grow up and learn all about computer science. Babies
      are the future after all. I like to drink lots of milk and like going
      to the park. There's not much else, yet, but I am here to stay.

    <p>Here are some of my favorite websites so far.</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://pbskids.org">PBS Kids</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.toysrus.com">Toys"R"Us</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Finally, I hope you enjoy my favorite song too!</p>
